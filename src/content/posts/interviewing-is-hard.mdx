If we compare the time we spend being interviewed versus interviewing others, we could find that the more senior we get, the more time we spend as interviewers. But, when we look at the amount of resources available (articles, tips, videos, etc.), the proportion doesn't quite match, given it is space full of content for candidates. It's an interesting observation (well, at least to me! 😅) Is it a matter of audience? Do we assume that interviewers are already skilled enough, leaving no room for growth?

Good interviewers bring significant value to their companies, so why not invest in becoming better at it?

"Okay Angel, good point, but where can I start?"

While I'm cooking up a more detailed post, here's where I would begin:

## Tips for Better Interviewing

**🎯 Clarify what you're assessing:** Whether it's coding, design, or values, be clear on what tangible skills or qualities you want to evaluate. The clearer you are, the better your questions and exercises will be.

**🛞 Learn to steer the interview:** If things aren't going well, instead of just leaning towards a "no," ask yourself, "What would the candidate need to do to turn my 'no' into a 'yes'?" Then guide the interview accordingly.

**🔎 Less fluff, more facts:** Instead of vague affirmations like "good problem-solving skills," provide concrete examples, e.g., "They asked insightful questions about feature X and chose solution Y after evaluating other solutions." This makes your observations clearer to those who weren't in the interview and also remove a lots of bias towards the candidate.

**👥 Be human and let the candidate be human.** Interviews are stressful and artificial situations and your job is to observe the candidate's performance as naturally as possible. Practice transitioning smoothly between interview sections, asking questions naturally, and adapting your follow-ups. No one likes being interviewed by a robot.

**⭐️ Enhance the interview process:** Poorly designed processes impact everyone. Don't hesitate to give feedback and proactively help evolve your company's interviews. Address issues like irrelevant questions, unnecessary steps, and unprepared candidates, I am sure everyone will be happy.

There is a lot more to say, about interviews… about soft skills… but that is another story and shall be said on another time.

**PS:** Eat your veggies 🌱
