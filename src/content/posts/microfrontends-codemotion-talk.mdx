This past year I've tried to participate more by giving talks both internally and at external events, but due to COVID many of those talks were canceled.

Looking on the bright side, I was able to participate in the [Codemotion Madrid](https://events.codemotion.com/conferences/online/2020/online-tech-conference-spanish-edition/), giving an introductory talk about microfrontends.

## Important Note

**I'm not an expert on the subject**, so this talk aims to provide an introduction, discuss the advantages and disadvantages, present some of the architectures used by large companies ([IKEA](https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/08/experiences-micro-frontends/) - Spotify), delve deeper into how PayPal (my former company) planned part of their microfrontends, and finish by talking about some technologies that exist to create your own microfrontends ([Single-SPA](https://single-spa.js.org/), [bit](https://docs.bit.dev/docs/workflows/microfrontends), [TailorJS](https://github.com/zalando/tailor), [Module Federation](https://module-federation.github.io/), [Portals](https://web.dev/hands-on-portals/)).

## What the Talk Covered

### Architecture Examples
- **[IKEA's approach](https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/08/experiences-micro-frontends/)** to microfrontend architecture
- **Spotify's** implementation strategies  
- **PayPal's** microfrontend planning and execution (insights from my time there)

### Technologies Discussed
- **[Single-SPA](https://single-spa.js.org/)** - A JavaScript router for front-end microservices
- **[bit](https://docs.bit.dev/docs/workflows/microfrontends)** - Tool for component-driven development
- **[TailorJS](https://github.com/zalando/tailor)** - Layout service for front-end microservices
- **[Module Federation](https://module-federation.github.io/)** - Webpack 5's approach to microfrontends
- **[Portals](https://web.dev/hands-on-portals/)** - Web standard for seamless navigation between sites

### Key Topics
- Advantages and disadvantages of microfrontend architectures
- When to use (and when not to use) microfrontends
- Real-world implementation challenges
- Team organization and development workflows

## Lessons Learned

The transition to virtual events due to the pandemic was challenging, but it also opened up opportunities to reach a broader audience. Speaking at Codemotion Madrid was a great experience that allowed me to share knowledge about an increasingly important architectural pattern in frontend development.

## Get in Touch

If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to contact me on my social networks. I hope to gradually upload more content like this.
