briefSummary: "Senior engineering experience is more valuable than ever with AI coding assistants. Success requires three key practices: well-structured requirements, tool-based guard rails like linting and testing, and file-based keyframing with stubs instead of letting AI create files freely."
personalNotes: "Well-structured Requirements, Tool-based Guard Rails, and File-based Keyframing. Those are the most important things. Lay out all the details you need, provide it a way of self-check like linting / testing and instead of letting it create files like crazy, provide stubs and guidelines so that it just fill gaps. It remains interesting for green field projects or high end finishers. But this should save hours and hours of work."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Senior developer experience is more valuable than ever in the AI age, not obsolete"
  - "Well-structured requirements guide AI to produce desired results"
  - "Tool-based guard rails (linting, testing) enable AI self-checking"
  - "File-based keyframing: provide stubs and guidelines instead of free file creation"
  - "Most effective for green field projects and high-end finishing work"
  - "Can save hours of development time when used correctly"

## My Thoughts

Well-structured Requirements, Tool-based Guard Rails, and File-based Keyframing. Those are the most important things. Lay out all the details you need, provide it a way of self-check like linting / testing and instead of letting it create files like crazy, provide stubs and guidelines so that it just fill gaps.

It remains interesting for green field projects or high end finishers. But this should save hours and hours of work.
