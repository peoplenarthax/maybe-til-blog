briefSummary: "You can't win an argument with a toddler because they're not actually having an argument - they're engaging in connection, noise, or status games. Real arguments are exchanges of ideas that surface insight and lead to conclusions, where you should expect to change your mind about half the time."
personalNotes: "You can't because toddlers (also known as people which hold discussions in this way), usually don't look for arguments or even in a way change their opinion on something, they have a hidden tantrum."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Toddlers (including defensive bureaucrats, bullies, and talk show hosts) aren't interested in actual arguments"
  - "Real arguments should lead to changing your mind about half the time"
  - "If you're not changing your mind, you're probably not having an actual argument"
  - "Test early: Ask about other positions they've changed through discussion"
  - "Don't argue over things people have chosen to believe as part of their identity"

## My Thoughts

You can't because toddlers (also known as people which hold discussions in this way), usually don't look for arguments or even in a way change their opinion on something, they have a hidden tantrum.

Actually you can check early on with: 

> "Tell me about other strongly-held positions you've changed as the result of a discussion like this one…" is a direct way to start a conversation about the argument you're proposing to have. "What sort of information would make it likely you could see this in a different way?"
