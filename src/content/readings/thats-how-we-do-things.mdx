briefSummary: "Blindly following established practices without understanding their rationale prevents innovation and adaptation. What works in one context may not work in another, so understanding the underlying principles is essential."
personalNotes: "Sometimes we do things without understanding the how or the why. This does not allow us to innovate or to actually adapt the things that we do to the context we have. For different context things may not work, so we should understand this in order to adapt."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Doing things without understanding why prevents innovation"
  - "Context matters - what works in one situation may fail in another"
  - "Understanding the 'how' and 'why' enables adaptation"
  - "Blindly following tradition limits organizational learning"

Sometimes we do things without understanding the how or the why. This does not allow us to innovate or to actually adapt the things that we do to the context we have. For different context things may not work, so we should understand this in order to adapt.
