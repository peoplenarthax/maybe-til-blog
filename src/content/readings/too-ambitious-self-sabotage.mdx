briefSummary: "The moment before creation, work exists in perfect form in your imagination. But creation is murder—killing the impossible in service of the possible. A photography experiment proves this: students graded on quantity (100 photos) produced better work than those focused on one perfect photo. Your taste develops faster than your skill, creating 'the gap.' Lower the stakes. Do. Learn. Repeat."
personalNotes: "Really love the article from Maalvika, and you can basically apply it anywhere. I have stumbled so many times planning. Planning is probably my best friend and my worst enemy. I spent a big amount of time just planning how things should happen, when probably I should just be making things happen instead. A blog? You can just do a link blog with your notes about readings (look at me :D). A boardgame? Get few mechanics down and start playing with it. A drawing? Go and paint/sketch... just do it. The gap between your taste and what you can produce is just gonna be bigger and bigger if you do not reduce some expectations and start from the simplest you can produce. As the article quotes: the learning never stops requiring the doing. The doing never stops requiring learning. So do not forget either."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Creation is not birth; it is murder of the impossible in service of the possible"
  - "Photography experiment: 100 photos (quantity) beat 1 perfect photo (quality)"
  - "Your taste develops faster than your skill—this creates 'the gap'"
  - "Productive avoidance: staying busy with planning while avoiding actual creation"
  - "Your brain treats planning as accomplishing—same neural reward circuits fire"
  - "Do-Learn philosophy from Olin College: start before you're ready"
  - "The quitting point separates creators from planners—push through the middle"
  - "Lower the stakes to create your best work"
  - "The learning never stops requiring the doing. The doing never stops requiring learning"

## My Thoughts

Really love the article from Maalvika, and you can basically apply it anywhere. I have stumbled so many times planning. Planning is probably my best friend and my worst enemy. I spent a big amount of time just planning how things should happen, when probably I should just be making things happen instead.

A blog? You can just do a link blog with your notes about readings (look at me :D). A boardgame? Get few mechanics down and start playing with it. A drawing? Go and paint/sketch... just do it.

The gap between your taste and what you can produce is just gonna be bigger and bigger if you do not reduce some expectations and start from the simplest you can produce. The photography class experiment is perfect—the students who took 100 photos learned by doing, while the ones focused on one perfect photo stayed stuck in theory.

As the article quotes: **the learning never stops requiring the doing. The doing never stops requiring learning.**

So do not forget either. You can't learn your way out of not doing, and you can't do without learning. They're the same thing.
