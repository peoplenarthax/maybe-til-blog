briefSummary: "There's a critical difference between being useful and being valued. Being useful means your mission is 'take care of that and don't screw up.' Being valued means you're brought into more conversations - not just to execute, but to help shape the direction."
personalNotes: "'Take care of that and don't screw up' is your mission when you're just useful. Being valued, on the other hand, means that you are brought into more conversations, not just to execute, but to help shape the direction."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Being useful ≠ being valued"
  - "Useful: 'Take care of that and don't screw up'"
  - "Valued: Brought into conversations to shape direction, not just execute"
  - "The distinction affects your career trajectory and satisfaction"

## My Thoughts

"Take care of that and don't screw up" is your mission when you're just useful.

Being valued, on the other hand, means that you are brought into more conversations, not just to execute, but to help shape the direction.
