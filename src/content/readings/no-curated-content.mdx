briefSummary: "The rise of social media has killed the art of curation. Where people once discovered great music and films through professional curators (college radio, MTV, Ebert and Roeper), now they must hunt through an endless sludge pile. Technology promised convenience but delivered exhaustion."
personalNotes: "Before, you could reach for a magazine once a month or a watch a show once a week, but now you have to browse Vulture every day and read all 20+ articles they publish, even on the weekends. Who has time to read all that? Who has the time for any of this? Technology is making our lives harder, not easier. With so much capacity to access content and the rise of social media is much more difficult to actually understand what is worth, hence having curated content is still key."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Social media scatters information like feeding bread to ducks"
  - "Before: one radio show, one TV program weekly was enough to stay culturally informed"
  - "Now: endless daily browsing through dozens of articles and posts"
  - "Algorithms keep you in a bubble, never surprising you with something different"
  - "We need critics who devote their lives to telling us what's worth our time"
  - "Technology is making our lives harder, not easier"

## My Thoughts

Before, you could reach for a magazine once a month or a watch a show once a week, but now you have to browse Vulture every day and read all 20+ articles they publish, even on the weekends. Who has time to read all that? Who has the time for any of this? Technology is making our lives harder, not easier.

With so much capacity to access content and the rise of social media is much more difficult to actually understand what is worth, hence having curated content is still key.
