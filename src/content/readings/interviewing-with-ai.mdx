## My Thoughts

With a bit of prompting and time, someone can really fake interviews about experience and values, so it is worth being in the look out for issues.

Key strategies to detect AI-assisted preparation:

1. **Even in behavioral interviews, ask detailed situational questions** - AI can talk about projects broadly but struggles to connect specific dots

2. **Ask questions that have to do with the human experience** - Most engineers should be able to explain how their technical solutions mapped to actual human problems

3. **Insist on camera ON phone screens** - Ensures the person's identity matches their profile

4. **Always make a reference check before hiring** - Essential final verification in the age of AI

5. **Conduct yourself with professionalism and empathy no matter what the situation** - Reputation goes both ways
