briefSummary: "Digital content constantly disappears through link rot, service shutdowns, and format obsolescence. Markdown offers the best solution for long-term preservation - it's human-readable, machine-parseable, and follows the 'rule of least power' principle."
personalNotes: "Simple yet true: web content disappears constantly. I've experienced this firsthand with thousands of lost bookmarks from Hacker News. Plain text, however, remains readable and searchable as long as computers exist. When I encounter valuable content, I make a copy. The article also references the rule of least power (choosing the least powerful computer language suitable for a given purpose), which perfectly applies to Markdown's design philosophy."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Digital content disappears constantly - links rot, services shut down, formats become obsolete"
  - "Markdown is the most durable format for long-term content preservation"
  - "Plain text files with UTF-8 encoding will remain readable as long as computers exist"
  - "The 'rule of least power' - choose the least powerful language suitable for the purpose"
  - "Content worth searching for once is content worth preserving forever"

## My Thoughts

Simple yet true: web content disappears constantly. I've experienced this firsthand with thousands of lost bookmarks from Hacker News. Plain text, however, remains readable and searchable as long as computers exist. When I encounter valuable content, I make a copy. The article also references the [rule of least power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power) (*choosing the least powerful computer language suitable for a given purpose*), which perfectly applies to Markdown's design philosophy.
