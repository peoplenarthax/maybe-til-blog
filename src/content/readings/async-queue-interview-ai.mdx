title: "Async Queue – One of My Favorite Programming Interviews (Can AI Break It?)"
description: "A classic programming interview about implementing a request queue that ensures only one server request processes at a time. The interview tests callback logic, single-threaded reasoning, and increasingly how well candidates can leverage AI tools."

briefSummary: "A programming interview given 500-1000 times over 7 years: implement sendOnce to queue server requests so only one processes at a time. Tests callback wrapping, flag logic, and single-threaded reasoning. Evolved requirements test code elegance and API design. AI can solve it with proper prompting, but the interview now tests how 'AI-native' candidates are—can they use AI for speed while properly reviewing generated code?"
personalNotes: "I find it quite interesting that even if it is a simple interview question easily done with AI, it already shows several points: understand the problem, leverage AI to solve it faster (aka AI Native scoring), and it works on existing code instead of building from 0 (just like real life!). We should be open to innovate in the interview space. This could be used in both AI and non-AI modalities. The question is not super hard itself, the thought process matters more than if a candidate will get the right answers."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Interview tests callback wrapping logic and single-threaded reasoning"
  - "Progressive requirements reveal code elegance and API design skills"
  - "AI can solve with proper prompting but code becomes convoluted"
  - "New dimension: testing how 'AI-native' candidates are"
  - "Best candidates use AI for speed but critically review generated code"
  - "Works on existing code (the send function) rather than building from scratch"
  - "Thought process matters more than getting perfect answers"

## My Thoughts

I find it quite interesting that even if it is a simple interview question easily done with AI, it already shows several points:

- **Understand the problem**: You still need to grasp what you're trying to solve before AI can help you
- **Leverage AI to solve it faster**: The "AI Native scoring" dimension where speed + quality matter
- **It works on existing code**: Instead of building from 0, just like real life!

We should be open to innovate in the interview space. This could be used in both AI and non-AI modalities. The question is not super hard itself—the thought process matters more than if a candidate will get the right answers.

What I appreciate most is that this interview evolves. It's not just "can you implement this function?" but rather "how do you handle new requirements? How does your code stay elegant? What's your API design philosophy?" These are the questions that matter in real engineering work.
