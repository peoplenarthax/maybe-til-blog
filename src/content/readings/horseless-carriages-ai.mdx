briefSummary: "Many AI systems are designed with pre-AI era assumptions, resulting in non-optimal experiences. The article argues for giving users control over system prompts, not just user prompts, to truly customize their AI agents."
personalNotes: "Here talks about how some systems that use AI are based on the pre-AI era and hence offer a non-optimal experience for those working with such systems. It talks about system and user prompts and talks about how to provide users with capabilities to modify the system prompt as well so that you can add on customizing your LLMs / agents."
keyTakeaways:
  - "AI systems often built with pre-AI era assumptions"
  - "This results in suboptimal user experiences"
  - "Users should have access to modify system prompts, not just user prompts"
  - "True customization requires control over the entire prompt structure"
  - "We're building 'horseless carriages' when we should reimagine from scratch"

## My Thoughts

Here talks about how some systems that use AI are based on the pre-AI era and hence offer a non-optimal experience for those working with such systems. It talks about system and user prompts and talks about how to provide users with capabilities to modify the system prompt as well so that you can add on customizing your LLMs / agents.
