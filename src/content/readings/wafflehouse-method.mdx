briefSummary: "Take two days off mid-week to do deep introspection: Day 1 at your favorite spot to vividly imagine yourself in 5 years, Day 2 at a Wafflehouse (or equivalent) to break that vision down into 5-year, 3-year, 1-year, monthly, weekly, and daily goals using a directed acyclic graph of 100+ concrete steps. Plan assuming every day will be a bad day."
personalNotes: "Super fan of ways of changing my life to become something better, even though the disclaimer is that, as you get on responsibilities with your family/friends, this becomes harder and harder, especially assuming that things will work in the worst case scenario (never true). Still, I think it's worth exercising introspection and direction and even if inertia itself will get you there or you need to fuel up things. As a person who is obscenely obsessed with learning and getting hobbies, I think that the most difficult part is to define what you like and what you wanna be. I will try to reserve two days for this method, thanks Yacine."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Take 48 hours mid-week alone for deep introspection"
  - "Day 1: Vividly imagine yourself in 5 years at your proudest"
  - "Day 2: Break down vision into 2-3 goals across 5-year, 3-year, 1-year timeframes"
  - "Create a DAG (directed acyclic graph) with 100+ concrete steps from now to 1-year goals"
  - "Plan assuming luck is against you and every day will be bad"
  - "Break down to monthly, weekly, and daily tasks starting immediately"
  - "The difficult part: defining what you like and who you want to be"
  - "Side effect: no one to blame but yourself"

## My Thoughts

Super fan of ways of changing my life to become something better, even though the disclaimer is that, as you get on responsibilities with your family/friends, this becomes harder and harder. Especially assuming that things will work in the worst case scenario, never true.

Still, I think it's worth exercising introspection and direction, realising if inertia itself will get you there or you need to fuel up things. As a person who is obscenely obsessed with learning and getting hobbies, I think that the most difficult part is to define what you like and what you wanna be.

The method resonates because it forces you to be concrete. Not just "I want to be successful" but actually breaking it down into real things.

I will try to reserve two days for this, thanks Yacine.
