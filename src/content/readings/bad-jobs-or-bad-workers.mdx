briefSummary: "The problem isn't that people are bad at their jobs - it's that jobs have become worse. The equation is simple: more customers + more profit pressure + stagnant wages = fewer employees working more hours for less pay. The optimization cycle and gig economy have created systematically demotivated workers."
personalNotes: "More customers + more pressure to create profit + stagnant wages = fewer employees working more hours for less pay. It is normal that jobs get people that are less and less motivated prepare because of the optimization cycle that society is suffering, specially with Gig-economy emerging from every corner."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Worker demotivation is a systemic issue, not individual failure"
  - "The equation: more customers + profit pressure + stagnant wages = overworked underpaid employees"
  - "Optimization cycles have made jobs progressively worse"
  - "Gig economy has accelerated this trend across industries"
  - "Less motivation is a rational response to deteriorating job conditions"

## My Thoughts

More customers + more pressure to create profit + stagnant wages = fewer employees working more hours for less pay.

It is normal that jobs get people that are less and less motivated prepare because of the optimization cycle that society is suffering, specially with Gig-economy emerging from every corner.
