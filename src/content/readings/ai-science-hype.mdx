briefSummary: "A Princeton physics PhD switched to studying machine learning for science, expecting revolutionary results. Instead, he found that AI methods performed much worse than advertised, comparisons were unfair, and the field suffers from survivorship bias since negative results are never published."
personalNotes: "Opposite to the hype created online, it seems that real advancements made by AI in different science fields is quite limited, basically it lacks reproducibility and it has fall in the hype wheel. It does not mean that AI can revolutionize, but real impact and frequency should still be challenged."
keyTakeaways:
  - "AI methods for solving PDEs performed much worse than advertised"
  - "Comparisons to standard methods were often unfair or misleading"
  - "Survivorship bias: negative results are almost never published in AI research"
  - "648 papers across 30 fields contain data leakage leading to overoptimistic results"
  - "DeepMind's 2.2M crystal structures discovery was 'mostly junk' according to materials scientists"
  - "Real impact and frequency of AI breakthroughs should be challenged"
  - "AI needs to match reliability and robustness of standard numerical methods"

## My Thoughts

Opposite to the hype created online, it seems that real advancements made by AI in different science fields is quite limited, basically it lacks reproducibility and it has fall in the hype wheel. It does not mean that AI can revolutionize, but real impact and frequency should still be challenged.

As the author notes:

> AI might eventually prove useful for certain applications related to solving PDEs, but I currently don't see much reason for optimism. I'd like to see a lot more focus on trying to match the reliability of numerical methods and on red teaming AI methods; right now, they have neither the theoretical guarantees nor empirically validated robustness of standard numerical methods.
