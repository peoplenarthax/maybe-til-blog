briefSummary: "The internet is adopting the Gruen Transfer concept from supermarkets - creating confusing layouts that make users wander and lose sense of their original action. This manipulation may eventually hit a tipping point similar to a Laffer Curve."
personalNotes: "Basically the internet uses this Gruen Transfer concept (the same as super markets when they make a confusing layout to make you wander, loss the sense of the original action). This should have some consequences in the future and maybe there would be a Laffer Curve of some kind to what is the limit of making this on purpose."
keyTakeaways:
  - "The Gruen Transfer: confusing layouts that make users lose track of original intent"
  - "Supermarket tactic now prevalent across internet platforms"
  - "May eventually reach a tipping point where over-optimization backfires"
  - "Possible Laffer Curve effect - too much manipulation reduces effectiveness"

## My Thoughts

Basically the internet uses this Gruen Transfer concept (the same as super markets when they make a confusing layout to make you wander, loss the sense of the original action). This should have some consequences in the future and maybe there would be a Laffer Curve of some kind to what is the limit of making this on purpose.
