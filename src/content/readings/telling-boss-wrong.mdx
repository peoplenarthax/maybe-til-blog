## My Thoughts

**Do:**
- Tailor how you express disagreement to your manager's style and priorities by observing how they react to others' pushback
- Lead with curiosity and ask open-ended questions, like "Help me understand what factors are influencing this decision?" to foster collaboration
- Pick your battles and know when to back off, especially in lower-stakes situations

**Don't:**
- React impulsively if your boss gets defensive; take a pause to ground yourself and calmly frame your feedback as supportive, not undermining
- Dig in your heels for the sake of it; stand firm but be open to alternatives and willing to find a middle ground
- Rub it in if you're right and your boss didn't listen; let them learn from their mistakes
