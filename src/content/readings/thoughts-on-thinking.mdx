briefSummary: "The melancholy of losing the feeling of being smart when AI provides instant answers. The act of wondering and processing ideas, even without completion, made us feel intellectually engaged in ways that instant access to answers cannot replicate."
personalNotes: "This felt a bit sad because is true. I used to feel smarter, when I could just wonder with my ideas even if never completed, to at least process it, and now it feels useless just because of how easy I can access answers without requirement to understand anything else. I hope I can still do writing and programming without LLMs."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Easy access to AI answers removes the joy of wondering and processing"
  - "The act of thinking through ideas made us feel intellectually engaged"
  - "Instant answers eliminate the need to understand underlying concepts"
  - "There's value in incomplete thoughts and the process of figuring things out"
  - "Risk of losing skills we once practiced regularly"

## My Thoughts

This felt a bit sad because is true. I used to feel smarter, when I could just wonder with my ideas even if never completed, to at least process it, and now it feels useless just because of how easy I can access answers without requirement to understand anything else.

I hope I can still do writing and programming without LLMs.
