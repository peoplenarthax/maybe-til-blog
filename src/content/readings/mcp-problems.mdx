briefSummary: "While MCP has rapidly become the de-facto standard for integrating third-party data and tools with LLMs, it has significant issues in protocol security, LLM security, UI/UX, and fundamental LLM limitations that need addressing before widespread adoption."
personalNotes: "There are some issues with MCPs that we need to make a formal standard on that protocol before adopting, eg: Protocol Security, LLM Security, UX/UI, limitations of LLMs. I think the main issue here is access control and how to determine for which agent what is the level of access / criticality of an action. Probably having a standard will be highly relevant here."
keyTakeaways:
  - "MCP has no concept of tool-risk levels or controls for action criticality"
  - "Protocol security issues include authentication problems and local code execution risks"
  - "No cost controls - token costs can escalate quickly with inefficient integrations"
  - "Access control remains the main challenge: determining levels per agent"
  - "LLM limitations negatively correlate with amount of instructional context"
  - "Formal standardization needed before widespread adoption"

## My Thoughts

There are some issues with MCPs that we need to make a formal standard on that protocol before adopting, eg: Protocol Security, LLM Security, UX/UI, limitations of LLMs. I think the main issue here is access control and how to determine for which agent what is the level of access / criticality of an action. Probably having a standard will be highly relevant here.
