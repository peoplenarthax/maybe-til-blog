briefSummary: "While static typing provides benefits, hyper-typing - excessive use of complex types - introduces significant downsides including poor formatting, incomprehensibility, unsafe workarounds, and error messages that are impossible to understand."
personalNotes: "Sometimes hyper typing comes with disadvantages: Badly-formatted type definition files, Difficult to understand types, Unsafe workarounds, Incomprehensible error messages."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Hyper-typing can lead to badly-formatted type definition files"
  - "Complex types become difficult to understand and maintain"
  - "Developers resort to unsafe workarounds to satisfy type checkers"
  - "Error messages become incomprehensible with complex type hierarchies"
  - "Balance is key - not all typing is beneficial typing"
