## Tag Selection Guidelines

### For New Content

1. **Choose 1-2 primary tags** that best represent the core topic
2. **Be specific but not overly narrow** - prefer existing tags over creating new ones
3. **Consider the main takeaway** - what would someone searching for this content look for?
4. **Automatically include `links/readings`** for all reading posts

### Decision Tree

Ask yourself:
- Is it about AI/ML? → `ai`
- Is it about career growth or planning? → `career`
- Is it technical (code, tools, architecture)? → `engineering`
- Is it about people skills? → `softskills`
- Is it about managing others? → `management`
- Is it about interviewing/hiring? → `interviews`
- Is it about work processes? → `work`
- Is it about learning/research? → `knowledge`
- Is it cultural commentary? → `culture`

### When to Create a New Tag

**Rarely!** Only create a new tag if:
1. The content doesn't fit any existing category
2. You expect 3+ more posts in this category soon
3. The category represents a distinct, valuable filter for readers

## Tag Evolution History

### December 29, 2025 - Major Consolidation
**Reason:** Too many single-use tags, inconsistent naming

**Changes:**
- Merged `soft-skills` and `softskills` → `softskills` (standardized)
- Merged `interviews` and `interviewing` → `interviews`
- Merged `work` and `working` → `work`
- Merged `frontend`, `backend`, `tooling` → `engineering`
- Merged `tech`, `social-media`, `rants` → `culture`

**Impact:** Reduced from 15+ tags to 8 core categories

**Files updated:** 13 reading posts

---

## Future Considerations

As the content library grows, monitor these potential splits:
- `engineering` might eventually split back if frontend/backend posts grow to 20+ each
- `leadership` could emerge as distinct from `management` if organizational strategy content grows
- `writing` could emerge if content creation posts increase

Revisit this document every 6 months or after adding 50+ new posts.
