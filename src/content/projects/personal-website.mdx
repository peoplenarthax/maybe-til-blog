# Personal Website & Blog

This is my personal website and blog, built from the ground up using modern web technologies with a focus on performance, SEO, and maintainability.

## Features

- **Static Site Generation**: Built with Astro for optimal performance
- **Content Management**: Type-safe blog posts using Astro's Content Collections
- **SEO Optimized**: Comprehensive meta tags, Open Graph, and JSON-LD structured data
- **Reading Experience**: Progress bars, estimated reading time, and responsive typography
- **Tag System**: Filterable blog posts with dynamic tag-based navigation
- **Dark Mode**: Elegant dark/light theme switching
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS

## Technical Highlights

The site uses Astro's Islands Architecture to deliver a fast, static-first experience while maintaining the ability to add interactive components where needed. Content is managed through MDX files with TypeScript validation, ensuring type safety and better developer experience.

Key performance metrics consistently score 100 on Lighthouse, with sub-second loading times and excellent Core Web Vitals scores.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Astro with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Content**: MDX for rich blog content with React components
- **Deployment**: Vercel with automatic deployments from Git

This project serves as both a personal brand platform and a showcase of modern web development practices.
