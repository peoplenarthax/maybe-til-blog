        'I like to define myself as a "proud holistic hobbyist" - I spend my free time painting, rollerblading, practicing judo and weightlifting, playing volleyball, birdwatching, taking photos, dancing, writing, and reading. I never have enough time for all my hobbies, making me a true jack of all trades, master of none. And I\'m perfectly fine with that.',

        "I studied Communication Systems Engineering (telematics specialty) at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. During university, I was an active student - I got involved with the student union, founded a student club as part of the Firefox Ambassador Program, and participate on the Microsoft Student Program. I organized hackathons and drove activities across the campus. Then I did my Erasmus at Mälardalen University in Västerås, Sweden, where I was part of the international committee taking care of other Erasmus students. There, I wrote my thesis on genetic algorithms for action planning for distributed autonomous underwater vehicles. After that, I started the Europhotonics Master Program - a triple diploma in Photonics Engineering across Marseille, Karlsruhe, and Barcelona ICFO, covering biomedical imaging, quantum optics, laser optics, and nanophotonics. But close to finishing my master thesis, I discovered something important: academia wasn't for me. What I truly enjoyed, what made me excited to wake up every morning, was software engineering.",

        "My professional journey started at Kambi, a sportsbook provider company that computed bets and offered embedded experiences for customers. Shortly after, I joined PayPal in the business credit team, where I became a Tech Lead. I led the micro frontends migration, owned the GraphQL Apollo Federation architecture, and delivered core features for credit experiences including dashboards and credit simulations. I also drove the integration with PayPal's Business Credit unit, defined the engineering roadmap, evolved team processes, and mentored engineers. When COVID hit, I decided to return to Spain and joined Glovo as a Staff Software Engineer in the Logistics as a Service team, where I also became an Engineering Manager. At Glovo, I led the cross-functional On-Demand Experiences team, delivering eCommerce integrations, core application pages, and last-mile delivery products. I also led the Admin Platform - Glovo's largest monorepo with over 90 contributors across 15+ product domains - where I standardized internal tooling like micro frontends and workflows across teams. I drove Social Impact initiatives as lead engineer within the logistics domain and was the Frontend lead at the interview committee, leading efforts to streamline the hiring process. I was also a project lead for Glovo's hackathon across several editions. Now at Datadog, I lead the Test Optimization team, continuing to bridge technical excellence with people leadership.",

        "Beyond my day job, I've spent time as a freelancer for small companies, doing quick prototypes and helping shape the first technical teams for startups that were just getting off the ground. I also offer mentoring online - I've helped people grow into senior software engineering roles and supported others through career switches into tech. Teaching has always been a passion of mine. I've given lessons in different schools, most recently at a bootcamp called Factoría F5, and I've also taught at universities. I've given several talks, mostly in Spanish, because I genuinely enjoy sharing what I know and learning from others in the process. I believe soft skills are as critical as technical ones - whether it's leading teams, mentoring engineers, or teaching, I'm passionate about helping others grow and succeed. This blog is part of that mission: sharing what I learn about problem-solving, interviewing, learning, and all the messy, human parts of building software and working with people.",
